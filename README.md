## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure my code is functional and secure by regularly running unit tests as I’m developing a program. I also need to make sure my tests are designed to ensure requirements are met, whether it’s for a client or for myself, such as in a personal project. I should test edge cases as well. As pieces of code are put together, I should also perform integration testing, which will likely show defects in how code modules interact with one another.

I can ensure my code is secure by following standard practices such as encapsulation and abstraction. I can also run dependency checks on my code and update libraries and plugins.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I can interpret user needs by writing down what the user would want. I then can translate these into system requirements. These requirements will then be used to design tests that the program will be run against. User needs should be translated into clear, objective requirements in order to be useful when developing a program.

## How do I approach designing software?

I try to approach designing software by keeping the user at the forefront. I write requirements based on the user needs, and I try to write the code itself for ease of usability. A program that isn’t designed for its users might not be used or might be difficult to use.
